# 🏨 Hotel Reservation System

🎉 **1st Place Winner** – FCIS Structured Programming Contest 2024  
📚 Developed as our first programming project during the _Structured Programming_ course at Ain Shams University – FCIS.

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a simple hotel reservation system with a graphical user interface built using **C++** and **Windows Forms**.  
It was our introduction to building structured applications and working with file-based data storage using **JSON**.

## ✨ User Features

- 🔐 Secure login and registration
- 🔍 Search for available rooms by date, time slot (morning, afternoon, evening), and type
- 📅 Book, view, modify, and cancel reservations

## 🛠️ Admin Features

- ➕ Add and manage rooms (type, price, availability)
